    """
    IVA is performed n_runs times with different initalizations.
    The most consistent demixing matrix along with the change in W for each iteration is returned,
    with the corresponding sources, mixing matrix, SCV covariance matrices.
    Consistence is measured by cross joint ISI, which can be returned optionally.


    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        data matrix of dimensions N x T x K (sources x samples x datasets)

    which_iva : str, optional
        'iva_g' or 'iva_l_sos'

    n_runs : int, optional
        how many times iva is performed

    kwargs : list
        keyword arguments for the iva function


    Returns
    -------

    iva_results : dict
        - 'W' : estimated demixing matrix of most consistent run of dimensions N x N x K
        - 'W_change' : change in W for each iteration of most consistent run
        - 'S' : estimated sources of dimensions N x T x K
        - 'A' : estimated mixing matrix of dimensions N x N x K
        - 'scv_cov' : covariance matrices of the SCVs, of dimensions K x K x N
        - 'cross_isi' : cross joint joint_isi for each run
        - 'cost' : cost of each run
        - 'joint_isi' : joint_isi for each run if true A is supplied, else None
